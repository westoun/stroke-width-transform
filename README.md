# Stroke Width Tranform

While experimenting with different computer vision techniques, I stumbled accross the paper
[Detecting Text in Natural Scenes with Stroke Width Transform](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5540041),
liked its core ideas, and decided to implement the algorithm based on my understanding.

If my implementation does not satisfy your needs, check
out [Christopher Bunn's version](https://github.com/mypetyak/StrokeWidthTransform).

Best regards!
